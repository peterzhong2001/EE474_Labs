# EE474_Labs

This is a collection of the labs that I have written in IAR for my EE 474 "Introduction to Embedded System Programming" class. All the code in this repository are written to be executed by a TexasInstruments TIVA Launchpad TM4C1294NCPDT microcontroller. I took this class at the University of Washington during summer quarter 2021 with Marcos Inonan.
